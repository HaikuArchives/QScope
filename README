  Description: Triggered oscilloscope
        Notes:

This program is a digital oscilloscope for the ADC and DAC sound
streams. It's usage should be fairly obvious for those of you familiar
with real-world oscilloscopes:

"Input" group:

  "Stream" : Selects between monitoring the ADC or the DAC stream
  "Channel": Chooses the left or right channel for display, or a
             dual-channel display

"Time" group:

  "Time/Div.": Sets the time equivalent to one horizontal division
               on the scope grid

"Trigger" group:

  "Channel"     : Selects which channel is used for the trigger
  "Trigger Mode": Possible choices are:
                  "Off" - no triggering
                  "Level" - normal triggering (settable level and slope)
                  "Peak" - automatic peak detection
  "Level"       : Trigger level (not used for peak trigger mode)
  "Slope"       : Trigger slope (not used for peak trigger mode)
  "Hold Off"    : Time to wait before retriggering (used to make the
                  display stable if it jitters)

"Illumination": Turn on backlight

If no trigger signal is detected after 1/30 of a second, the beam is
restarted. Signals <30Hz therefore usually cannot be triggered reliably.
